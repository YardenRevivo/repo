	 	     C# Evrica Park Application by Yarden Revivo
=========================================================================================

In this project I wrote a c# application using sql that support all the needs of the park and will even streamline the way of storing data and information. 
The app will help manage customer and employee cards, alert of stock shortages, alert of birthday events and thus be a helpful factor in improving customer relationships. 
In addition, the system will assist in the day-to-day management of the after-hours program - allocating rooms and instructors, thereby streamlining these processes. 
The new system will assist in the production of statistical reports and thus leverage the learning process of the organization.
I believe that this app will lead the organization and assist it in achieving its business goals.
