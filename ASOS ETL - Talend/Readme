=========================================================================================

In this project I established a prototype for a BI / DW system that will support the decision-making processes in ASOS, 
and its purpose is practical experience in the tools and techniques of the Business Intelligent field. 
The project is based on the selection of raw databases, which reflect business processes in a particular business environment, 
and the construction of a data management system that will enable the construction of business intelligence applications to support management 
decisions related to these processes.
