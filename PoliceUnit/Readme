	 	     Police Unit - Object Oriented Java programming project by Yarden Revivo
=========================================================================================

The main subject of the project is to practice creating classes, constructors, methods and using them by creating and running object instances.
Practice of inheritance, polymorphism, aggregation and encapsulation.
Use of abstract classes and interfaces and use of exception.

The goal of this exercise is to experiment with "simultaneous" programming and synchronization between threads, 
using different tools. This project focuses on aspects of the principles of object-oriented software development.

The backgroung story:
In this project, I implemented the array of calls that come to the PoliceUnit call center for the application, 
and computerize the work process from the stage of reporting the event to the end.

Process description in general:
Calls for reporting crime incidents come in line for calls. There are 5 call centers that receive the calls. 
Each call includes information about the report (address, severity of the incident, etc.). 
The caller who receives the call creates an event in the system that includes the details received in the call. 
The call centers enter the events as "criminal incidents", in the order in which the reports arrive. 
There are 3 event handlers responsible for pulling the events out of line and converting the event address miles away from the station and tracking the various events. 
Immediately afterwards, the person in charge of the event forwards the event to the station's information system. 
There are 3 station workers responsible for calculating the number and type of vehicles that will be sent to the event. 
After calculating the number of vehicles, the station staff puts the event in line for events waiting to be shipped. 
Then, there are 5 mission commanders who pull the events out of this queue and drive with the help of the vehicles, depending on the event.
